# Runge-Kutta-Solver
Python code to solve IVPs given a Runge Kutta method encoded as a Butcher Tableau.

This can be used to solve initial value problems of the form  $洧녬x/洧녬洧노=洧녭(洧노,洧논)$, 洧논(洧노0)=洧논0 using either explicit or diagonally implicit Runge Kutta methods, defined in the form of a Butcher Tableau. More information can be found here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods.
